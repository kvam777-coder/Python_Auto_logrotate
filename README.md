# Python_Auto_logrotate

Log rotation system implemented in Python. Log rotation is a common practice in software development and system administration, where log files are periodically rotated or archived to prevent them from growing too large and consuming all available disk space. Log rotation is important for managing log files and ensuring that you have access to historical logs without overwhelming your system's storage.

To create a simple Python log rotation script, you can use the logging library, which is part of Python's standard library. This script will automatically rotate log files based on predefined criteria. Here's an example:

Explain the code:
In this code:

We import the necessary modules from the logging library.
We configure the log filename, the maximum log file size (max_log_size), and the number of backup log files to keep (backup_count).
We create a logger with the name 'my_logger' and set its logging level to DEBUG.
We create a RotatingFileHandler, specifying the log file, maximum log size, and the number of backup log files.
We define a log message format using a formatter and apply it to the handler.
We add the handler to the logger.
Finally, we provide an example of how to use the logger to log messages at various log levels (debug, info, warning, error, and critical)
